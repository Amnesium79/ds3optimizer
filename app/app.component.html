<h2>Dark Souls III Optimizer</h2>

<p>First things first: I did not make this. All functionality was made by 3dot, his original optimizer and github can be found <a href="https://github.com/3dots/ds3optimizer">here.</a> All I did was update the data and include DLC2 gear.</p> 
<p>If this somehow works out, I'll make a pull request to add it into the original or sth (If you can't tell, I really don't know how this all works).</p>
<p>While Vigor is crucial, sometimes you want to have the best armor for a boss or situation.</p>
<p>Data from Patch 1.13 Regulation 1.33; data on changes to armour taken from Naiyts table.</p>
